  aims to help researchers get their work done
  in less time and with less pain
  by teaching them basic research computing skills.
  This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools,
  including program design and task automation.
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.

  The best way to learn how to program is to do something useful, 
  so this introduction to Python is built around a common scientific task: data analysis. 
  We are studying inflammation in patients who have been given a new treatment for arthritis, 
  and need to analyze the first dozen data sets of their daily inflammation. 
  The data sets are stored in comma-separated values (CSV) format.
